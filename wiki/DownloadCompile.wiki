= Getting the Source Code =

If you decided you want to build the application yourself, then you will first need to download the source code.  All of the source is kept in a SVN repository.  If you just want to anonymously check out the code then do the following:

svn checkout http://wildcat-cad.googlecode.com/svn

If you are a project member and will be modifying the code then you need to authenticate your checkout.  Use the following command:

svn checkout https://wildcat-cad.googlecode.com/svn
